One in blue one in white. Shot from above so you look down at them the way you look down at something precious in a case.

Sacred. Powerful. Neglecting them brings ruin. Three hundred miles east the same birth was an abomination and the babies were killed. Same face, opposite story. When one twin dies a wooden figure is carved and dressed and fed as if the child is still breathing.

Studied art at UNAM, found it too conservative. Went to Madrid, felt what it was like to be the immigrant, the Other, and said that vulnerability became the work. Back in Mexico City he hosted the Friday Workshop — weekly meetings for five years with Damián Ortega, Abraham Cruzvillegas, Gabriel Kuri, Dr. Lakra. The group changed Mexican contemporary art. He cut a Citroën DS into thirds and put it back together thinner. Drew a geometric pattern across every surface of a human skull while recovering from a collapsed lung. Pushed the field of a chessboard past its edges. Moved between Tokyo, Mexico City, and New York — no home base, just wherever the next object was. His urgent struggle, he said, was to find something that was not art. In 2006 he went to Isla Arena — whale mating ground, whale cemetery, industrial wasteland — and pulled a gray whale skeleton from the sand. Drew on its bones. Hung it from the ceiling of a library in Mexico City. Six years later he went back to the same beach and collected everything else. Nearly twelve hundred objects that Pacific currents carried from across the ocean and deposited on a wildlife reserve. Buoys that marked shipping lanes. Light bulbs that lit rooms. Bottles that held things someone drank. He sorted them by color and material and laid them on a gallery floor in the Guggenheim.

Had a crisis when he realized there was too much of a gap between what he wanted to say and the means he had to say it. Started putting words on canvas. Stenciled Zora Neale Hurston's line 'I feel most colored when I am thrown against a sharp white background' and let the text blotch and smear as it went down the surface until the words became the color they described. Stenciled the opening of Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man in shades of black and gray until the words disappeared. Stenciled Gertrude Stein's phrase 'negro sunshine' — a broad racial stereotype from 1909 — and turned it into white neon. His job, he says, is not to produce answers but to produce good questions. In 2006 he started making the word AMERICA in neon. First version faced the wall — every letter turned away from the viewer. He named it Rückenfigur, the German term for a figure seen from behind contemplating a landscape. Second version doubled the word and stacked it against its own mirror image, imperfectly joined. This version — 2018 — hangs upside down, painted black, flickering red, buzzing. He was thinking about Dickens. Best of times, worst of times. We can elect Barack Obama and still torture people in Cuba. Those things happen at the same time. The black paint over the neon gets read as Black America, white America, he said, and those kind of binaries, which is a part of it. But maybe if the piece has richness, it is because of the ambiguity. Paint is a material. Language is a material. Neon is a material. He plays with the word AMERICA as material — crosses it out, inverts it, makes it blink on and off obnoxiously. It's all a way of playing with this word when we think we know what it means. The letters are in American Typewriter font. Each one is a single tube. They float. Remove the cables and they fall apart. From the floor looking up it feels like the word is toppling. A curator in Arkansas asked what the flickering obnoxious red neon is trying to tell you. Is it a warning. Is it a celebration. Does it represent you in any way. Ligon never answers.
