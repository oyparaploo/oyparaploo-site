Studied art at UNAM, found it too conservative. Went to Madrid, felt what it was like to be the immigrant, the Other, and said that vulnerability became the work. Back in Mexico City he hosted the Friday Workshop — weekly meetings for five years with Damián Ortega, Abraham Cruzvillegas, Gabriel Kuri, Dr. Lakra. The group changed Mexican contemporary art. He cut a Citroën DS into thirds and put it back together thinner. Drew a geometric pattern across every surface of a human skull while recovering from a collapsed lung. Pushed the field of a chessboard past its edges. Moved between Tokyo, Mexico City, and New York — no home base, just wherever the next object was. His urgent struggle, he said, was to find something that was not art. In 2006 he went to Isla Arena — whale mating ground, whale cemetery, industrial wasteland — and pulled a gray whale skeleton from the sand. Drew on its bones. Hung it from the ceiling of a library in Mexico City. Six years later he went back to the same beach and collected everything else. Nearly twelve hundred objects that Pacific currents carried from across the ocean and deposited on a wildlife reserve. Buoys that marked shipping lanes. Light bulbs that lit rooms. Bottles that held things someone drank. He sorted them by color and material and laid them on a gallery floor in the Guggenheim.

Parents got scholarships to send him and his brother to a progressive private school on the Upper West Side. Studied at Wesleyan, then worked as a proofreader at a law firm while painting like de Kooning and Pollock in his spare time. Had a crisis when he realized there was too much of a gap between what he wanted to say and the means he had to say it. Started putting words on canvas. Stenciled Zora Neale Hurston's line 'I feel most colored when I am thrown against a sharp white background' and let the text blotch and smear as it went down the surface until the words became the color they described. Stenciled the opening of Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man in shades of black and gray until the words disappeared. Stenciled Gertrude Stein's phrase 'negro sunshine' — a broad racial stereotype from 1909 — and turned it into white neon. His job, he says, is not to produce answers but to produce good questions. In 2006 he started making the word AMERICA in neon. First version faced the wall — every letter turned away from the viewer. He named it Rückenfigur, the German term for a figure seen from behind contemplating a landscape. Second version doubled the word and stacked it against its own mirror image, imperfectly joined. This version — 2018 — hangs upside down, painted black, flickering red, buzzing. He was thinking about Dickens. Best of times, worst of times. We can elect Barack Obama and still torture people in Cuba. Those things happen at the same time. The black paint over the neon gets read as Black America, white America, he said, and those kind of binaries, which is a part of it. But maybe if the piece has richness, it is because of the ambiguity. Paint is a material. Language is a material. Neon is a material. He plays with the word AMERICA as material — crosses it out, inverts it, makes it blink on and off obnoxiously. It's all a way of playing with this word when we think we know what it means. The letters are in American Typewriter font. Each one is a single tube. They float. Remove the cables and they fall apart. From the floor looking up it feels like the word is toppling.

It has a deck, a ladder, pool accessories, lighting, everything you would expect from a functioning swimming pool. It appears full of water. People are standing at the bottom. Their clothes are dry. Their hair is not wet. They are looking up at you through the surface and you are looking down at them and neither of you is swimming. The water is a pane of glass with a thin layer of water on top. The room underneath is dry. The promise the floor made, that it was deep, that it would hold you suspended, was always a lie told with architecture.\n\nHe was born in 1973 in Buenos Aires. Had his first solo exhibition at eighteen. The family background was architecture and that is where the deception begins. He builds staircases that lead nowhere, elevators that do not move, building facades laid flat on the ground with mirrors angled so passersby appear to be climbing walls. Borges and Hitchcock in every piece. The work is not about tricks. It is about the moment after the trick when you realize the floor you trusted was never there. What the floor promised was depth and safety and the possibility of crossing. What the floor delivered was a surface and a view of someone else on the other side of it, equally trusting, equally wrong.", territory: "What the Floor Promised", sources: [{ label: "Sean Kelly Gallery", url: "https://www.seankellynyc.com/artists/leandro-erlich" }, { label: "21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa", url: "https://www.kanazawa21.jp/en/" }], palette: null, created: "2026-02-11T01:11:00.000Z", updated: "2026-02-11T01:11:00.000Z" },

The colors are the colors of packaging, white and translucent and blue and green, the palette of convenience, the palette of what you throw away without thinking. The form is beautiful. The material is garbage. The beauty is the problem.\n\nShe was born in 1960 in Sacramento. Studied photography at CalArts under John Baldessari but came to being an artist after studying philosophy. She makes objects that exist in what she calls two or more places at once. A chain-link fence curved into a Möbius strip. A ceramic culture growing bacteria in the gallery. A steel form that changes shape depending on where you stand. The compressed plastic piece takes the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and brings it indoors and gives it a body.

White and yellow lines drawn across it like roads on a map or boundaries on a field or chalk marks on a crime scene. Objects scattered across the surface, fabric bundles, found materials, string connecting points that may or may not lead anywhere. The map does not match any territory. It does not try to. It maps the space between places rather than the places themselves. The space of transit. The space of not arriving.\n\nHe was born in 1975 in Bakenberg, a small village in the northernmost province of Limpopo, South Africa. At the time it was located in KwaNdebele, one of the apartheid-era Bantustans, a homeland designated by the white government for Black people to live in so they would not need to live among whites. The homeland was the map. The person inside it was the territory the map refused to hold. Langa left and has been moving since, living across Europe and Africa, making work about the experience of being in between. The rust-red floor is the ground. The white lines are the borders.

The stone had bent. Not broken. Bent. The way a rigid thing learns to accommodate the pressure applied to it over centuries. That is the image he has been working with for fifty years. Laminated wood, steamed and curved. Galvanized steel, twisted and riveted. The forms look like ears, or eyes, or shells, or the space inside a mouth when it opens to speak. He calls himself a fabricator, not a sculptor. The difference matters to him. A sculptor removes material. A fabricator adds and joins.\n\nHe was born in 1949 in Bangor, Wales. Studied at Somerset College of Art and Saint Martin's in London, where Anthony Caro was teaching. He rivets and bolts and screws and glues. The joints are visible. The effort of bending is not hidden. Every seam says this was straight once and someone bent it. He read Rilke's Sonnets to Orpheus and thought about how a poem bends language the way his sculpture bends wood. The form holds the memory of the force that shaped it. A curve in laminated wood remembers every layer that resisted and every layer that gave.

Syrian thistle, Gundelia tournefortii, the plant Palestinians call akkoub, one of the most culturally significant wild plants in the Palestinian diet, foraged from hillsides in spring, cooked with lamb, preserved, remembered. It grows through rubble. It grows through demolished walls. It grows through the cracks in military roads. The light in the gallery is the color of a bruise healing or a sunset in a place where the sunset is the only thing the occupation cannot confiscate.\n\nOn March 19, 2014, a fourteen-year-old Palestinian boy named Yusef al-Shawamreh crossed the Israeli separation wall near Hebron to pick akkoub. He was shot and killed. He was foraging for a plant his family had foraged for generations on land his family had walked for generations. Basel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme are Palestinians based between Ramallah and New York. Their installations combine sound, video, digital archives, found objects, and living plants to document what they call the ongoing process of being made to disappear and the ongoing process of refusing to.
