The child asks what the adult forgot to wonder. Mastery is not perfection — it's knowing which flaws to keep. The crack lets the light in.

Curiosity before fear set in. The child picks up the dead bird to look closer. The master picks up the broken thing and sees what it's becoming. Imperfections as evidence of living.

The child mind stays available. The master mind knows how to use what it's given. Combined: play with weight. Immersion happens when the watcher forgets they're watching.

Allowed is not the same as taken. Someone consented to be seen. The gaze that lasts hours is not casual — it's a promise to stay. Imperfections as honesty: the smooth thing lies.

Child curiosity lives in the leaning forward, the fingers reaching before permission. Mastery lives in the hands that have done this ten thousand times. Hours of gazing changes the eyes — the dryness, the softened focus, the forgetting to blink.

We didn't expect to enter. Hours pass and we don't notice. That's not entertainment. That's a kind of love.
