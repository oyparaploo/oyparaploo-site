Also. this is all just for the sake of the work itself

It was when we became the biggest fans of ourselves that everything took off. and then crashed. and took off and crashed again.

Living living art.

We do not have to be living next new art work artists. we do not have to be a pro athlete or reality television star to be somebody on this planet.

We tell our children this. for ourselves.

The most frustrating thing is that scratch scribble. our not exactly knowing what great mortal conceived and produced work is. is part of what makes us who we are.

It will all most likely thrive immensely. if it has enough soul to appeal. to relate. to connect with millions of human beings.

Everyone just wants to do better. we all have that in common.

. . .

Regarding putting down words. spoken words. chatter at their very best. we are doing what feels natural and harmless. and what it is frequently changes.

Goes to where arrangements of our lives. and stuff. and arrangements of our lives. tied together to achieve sound inspirations. and demonstrate processes of experimenting.

Performed just for the sake of the work itself.
