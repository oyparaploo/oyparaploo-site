We sit here drinking Yuban coffee from a heart embossed cup and Chai Rooibos tea from another cup that is also a mouth. Sipping in free new prospects of the day. At best life is warm hot and sweet as boyhood nectar on the tongue. We will leave the trickles and streams of art agony for another place. We are up out of bed. finished with breakfast. feeling better. and ready to go. Today it will be willful un-stylish interpretations of sacred grounded reality. That wide open.

Numerous artistic works for progressives and conservatives alike lay half finished. As piles. As part of our days during some moments nothing is simple and everything is clear. Visual emotion results are also sideways and upside down. Which is the correct orientation for visual emotion results.

Messages and other content are as succinct and uncertain convoluted as life itself. Beyond these walls and over oceans where the walls continue but are made of water.

To create and have it all flow natural. happen naturally. And the silent and spoken questions. Is there a God in the midst of the insane senseless violence read about in magazines and newspapers and seen on screens. The screens do not answer. The screens just keep showing.

Concerns for self and others. Safety and direction of this country. Absorbing realities and letting it all be away for a while to make wonderful art to lift weighted and overloaded dispositions. The dispositions do not know they are being lifted. They think they are falling.

Superstitious conscience cloth wheels go round and round for a while and somewhere else on a stage a student recites her best street poetry. Shouts. cries. and whispers. Our work advocates for the tired living in the widening gap and celebrates good dedications and deeds. We stir with love because what is the point of existing without passion for goodness and growing love. It is something worthwhile to aim for during familiar wrangling. If you choose to pray to Jesus then Jesus Christ was all about social justice. This is not controversial. This is arithmetic.

This world with art is aflame and extinguished over and over. It teaches and learns outside of ourselves. Fears and portrays predictors of approaching danger and evil actions. Yearnings and ambitions to shed light on important issues and nurture good things for audiences and individuals after having passed through mine fields. subject matter speaking. The mine fields are metaphorical. Except when they are not.

People like us work better alone. Introversion is normal. The alone space powers great work. Too much chitter chatter is an energy drain. There is nothing better than enlarging free inner space. The space does not ask to be enlarged. It enlarges when you stop filling it with noise.

Soul mate. May your days continue to be sun drenched. May you continue to renew yourself as you do. Now that spring is just around the corner continue to be the shining waters that you are. We benefit greatly from the always fresh sound of your voice and of course boundless love. This is not a greeting card. This is what a person says to another person when the coffee is still warm and the morning is doing that thing where light comes through the kitchen window at exactly the right angle.

We saw a man with large frizzy hair driving a jeep and obviously arguing with arm gestures on a cell phone. Holding a phone to his ear. We think he was most likely steering the vehicle using his legs. This is a portrait of the twenty-first century painted by a jeep.

Real human violence has occurred since the beginning of humans. But we as a planet can do whatever is needed to reduce it. Especially since the weapons now are a lot more powerful than during the time when the United States Constitution was written. The Constitution did not anticipate the jeep either.

ART CAN BE MADE IN FORWARD GEAR AND REVERSE. CONSTRUCTION AND THEN DECONSTRUCTION AND VISA VERSA. BUILDING WITH MORE CLARITY AND THEN VISUAL DISINTEGRATION. These different ways of making art invigorate what will come next. New things. It keeps the process alive and fresh. Even if it does not fall on the mind immediately in a good way. Sometimes it falls on the mind like a sardine falls on snow.

Something often begins with nothing. Some things are a mystery and other stuff is real and common. Perspectives change. Every day has some amount of getting feelings out of ourselves as expressions. The expressions do not always agree with the feelings. The feelings do not always agree with the day.

We were deep in a night dream and pushed a strange button to call for The Fire Department. We realized they were on their way and called to tell them that they did not need to come and woke up. We thought about people trapped by and in fires. Basement fires and big rural wildfires. The button is still there in the dream. It has not been unpushed. The fire department is still technically on its way.

Lay your burdens down Brother. Hey Midnight Songbird. Where are you going. Nunavut. Night Sun Day Moon. Strum by the Primal Night Fire. Shame Killed Holy Bushes. Run away Camel. Here we are. Further from The Silent Timeless Desert Ruins. The Still Empathetic Prophet is my Darling. An ounce of remaining Bliss. In Don se Scran se Dali oow. This paragraph arrived from a country that does not appear on any map and we are letting it stay.

We can keep a stiff upper lip more than most. But soft love is what life should be about as much as possible. Flying-and-floating-through-rich-big-city-intersection-music-soul-alive-feeling-love. When you hyphenate enough words together they become one word and that word means everything at once which is the only honest way to describe a Tuesday.

We like hard work and strong discipline even though it sometimes makes us ill. Not well. It is in our nature. Chemical makeup. We would like to change. We hope to change it because it is not humanly sustainable. The chemicals have not been consulted.

There are moments when everything as a whole seems absolutely natural. We are doing exactly what we are supposed to be doing. There are other moments when it seems like it is all a complete waste of time and we should be doing something else. It sometimes is like a dream that has nothing to do with our life. We have come to determine that both sides are a part of what the work is about. This is universal and can help others on the same necessary roller coaster. The roller coaster does not have a safety inspector. The roller coaster is the safety inspector.

We have created many very large paintings during our life. And since when we dream at night the dreams are under our eyelids. the paintings we create can be small. Something the audience walks up to. Small and intimate. The eyelid is the smallest gallery in the world. It shows the largest paintings.

Something about eyes. Windows to the inner human soul as is in some old or ancient quote. How eye contact is becoming an increasingly difficult thing as the result of the popularity and use of social media and other technologies. The windows are still there. People are just looking at smaller windows now.

When we are into some complex art thing that is difficult to do. having a lot of experience with naturally working through a flow is needed. We had to work where the solutions were not worked out for a long time in order to get to this point where the finishings seem to be happening now all at once. The solutions were hiding behind the problems the whole time. Wearing the problems' clothes.

SLIGHTLY SKEWED WINTER. FEBRUARY 8TH. MEMORY.

The smell of cold cod makes the bears run and jump. We are pushing a black wheelbarrow filled with silver sardines over crusty mounds and powdery snow banks. Big lake low light and dark gray waves curl forward. splash a little and smooth out towards us. ice and sand. We take off our mitt and scratch a small patch of dry skin over our eyelid. The sardines are not cold. The sardines are past cold. The sardines have achieved a temperature that only fish and February understand.

During a winter morning with ice crystals hanging in the air. he stopped his van at an urban railroad crossing. The arms were down. the crossing lights were flashing. and the bell was dinging. He waited as the traffic lines gradually grew longer on both sides and then got out of his vehicle and walked past the visual obstacles up to the tracks and saw that there was no train coming from either direction. so he drove around the gates and continued on. The others did the same. During a part of this time span a meteor streaked close to the earth and exploded. injuring 700 people. The train that was not coming and the meteor that was not expected arrived at the same intersection of probability and one of them won.

A portion of our art consists of what we think of as Honest Universal Contradictions. A firm conviction of something on one day or at one moment and then an almost opposite perception and intention shortly after. The contradiction does not cancel itself out. The contradiction is the art. The two convictions sit in the same room and do not fight because they have learned that fighting is for people who think they are right. Being right is a kind of illness that looks like health.

We understand that contemporary art is done for many purposes. But the kind of things that have resonated with us since the beginning of making serious art have been small intimate works. Works that are not created to appeal to a current trend but consistently year after year say something real about the artist's life. The quality distinctiveness and richness is its natural truth. It can connect to a remote rural field or big city alley grit and anything in between. The field and the alley have never met but they would get along.

The mind of good perceptions moves like spirit is imagined. Graceful and near invisible. This is how morning begins. The following hours are filled with courage. agitation. and warrior art-making. By afternoon the warrior is washing brushes and wondering what to eat.

It is always interesting how a new day cleanses clears out or changes concerns of the night before. Compression and weight of thoughts of extreme competition. scattered groundless memories. and negative perceptions of our art results. all mixed together. A new morning thankfully and almost miraculously clears it all out. We are feeling content while washing dishes and listening to music. We go in the studio. turn on the lights. and like everything we see. This is the miracle. Not the parting of seas. The liking of everything at 7 AM.

During the cold days of winter people with mental health challenges spend their hours in the downtown library. They sit at tables. walk around and watch us fanning through books for visual references on the mezzanine level. A man stands on the other side of one bookshelf and pretends to be reading but he is really peeking through trying to see what we are doing. On the way out a young man sits by the exit curled forward and bobbing. How can he listen to that rap music so loud through tiny earphones. We are glad they have a place to be when it is too cold to sit in the park. The library does not ask anyone what they are reading or whether they are reading at all. The library just stays warm.

We met with a writer in a coffee shop who said it is impossible to create something original anymore with all that has been done. He made us angry inside and we never talked to this acquaintance again. Now we think it is possible to create more subtle degrees of originality if not dramatically different works. The writer is still in the coffee shop. The coffee is cold. The writer has not created anything since making that announcement. We have created several thousand things. Some of them original. Some of them not. All of them made.

Still be careful driving out there when the streets are clear and dry. Early this morning we passed through a fresh intersection crash with two compact cars half mangled and steaming like teapots in a still eerie frozen scene. One compressed into an unbent traffic light pole and the other sitting on the nearby boulevard. Someone must have gone through a red light. Fortunately both drivers were able to walk from their wrecks as a half dozen people or so stopped and started to gather. Two teapots that used to be cars. The tea is steam. The sugar is glass.

In the night bedroom we toss and turn. Face buried in pillows wrapped around our head. We get up. piss. shut the door. and go back to bed. We get up and go out to see our ill daughter resting on the couch. She said she is feeling better. Back in the bedroom we look through a split in the blinds and see absolute stillness. blue cast neighborhood. Back under the covers this time rolling with yesterday's leaves. The leaves are not in the bed. The leaves are in the mind. The mind does not know the difference. Neither do the leaves.

You may feel a lot of restless wondering if you are creating or doing the right thing. The fluttering feeling will go away if you ground yourself with your reality. Your paintings. drawings. photographs. collected objects. domestic comforts. or recollection of places. Be at or go to wherever you need to make something positive happen. You may be surprised with what you come up with. It may very well strengthen your spirit. The spirit was already strong. It just forgot where it put its keys.

A bright red and a warm gray cardinal have joined the fly-here-and-there sparrows in our backyard. We also notice a baby woodpecker pecking on an evergreen branch. A finch shot like a rocket straight up to the top of the hackberry. The finch did not file a flight plan. The hackberry did not grant clearance. The sky is not in charge of the finch. The finch is in charge of the sky.

The flu caused us to slow down. clench the sides of our head with our hands. and without wanting to review over in our mind what we have been up to over the past few months. We look forward to getting back to 100% and the lightness of just doing. With more empathy for anyone that is not feeling well. The flu is a small tyrant with a short reign and a long memory.

Now there is a lot more amazing extreme performances displayed on the internet. We were into that during the beginnings of social media. Since then we have gradually become more interested in getting back to the richness of sincere personal and truthful realism. The herd seems to be going in the direction of tech-wowsmanship judging by the enormous numbers of views and likes. The likes are not love. The views are not seeing. The numbers are not counting anything that matters.

While on a tall ladder be cautious of the coming and going wasp. If it aggravates you too much use a fly swatter and flatten it where it lands. If your surfaces are irregular hit it out of the air while of course maintaining your balance. A broom is more awkward to use on a ladder and the bristles do not always work best for killing insects. This is the most practical paragraph in the entire archive and it is surrounded on all sides by existential crisis which is exactly how a wasp works.

Our daughter and we walk to where we pole walk. Through changing light intersections holding our poles horizontal and pointing forward. When we get to the great big open grass valley we chop the pole points into the sod with contentment of familiarity. Eagerness to go on another walk same as many before. We move fast and pierce our points enjoying the repetitive sound of the poles and footsteps. We head towards a baseball field being irrigated. big spray bringing to the wet surface earthworms causing the birds to rejoice fly around and get their breakfast. Before the white gray misty spray.

This is invigoration. Rejuvenation. Early Morning Movement And Its Effect On Cerebral Invigoration. We pole walk to the beat down to a duck pond fluttering a flock airborne to a long and wide cluster of reeds and cattails laughing and murmuring. We pole on to the gothic rod iron exit where college students walk to their classes and other people wait at the bus stop for the accordion express bus to Minneapolis. The accordion bus opens and closes like a breathing thing. The students do not notice. The bus does not care. The poles are still in our hands. pointed forward.
