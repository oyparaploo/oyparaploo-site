Believable.

Smiling face. No blame. Kiss chords carded soil.

Like carbon concrete hearts. damaged.

Icy 30 east shipyard.

Cali bungalow ghost.

There is something a lot more truthful as seamed recordings and showing more close incremental incidences.

. . .

We waited for our ship that was supposed to return and bring us back to our home place.

We climbed the hill next to the city and looked out at the ocean.

Low and behold here comes the ship now. through the mist.

Window shutters of our hearts flung open and a sweet bird as joy floated then flew out over the sea. with the surface of the waters as play of good shadows and changing light.

Yes.

We closed our eyes at that moment and said each our own prayer. along with the silences of that deep and wide open space with dulled sparkles.

. . .

We walked down the hill and an unexplainable sadness floated in.

And I thought. how can we go from this place without a wounded heart.

Spirits.

What about the ship.

That was just a figment.

Let's just go.
