Mirrored by Space and Time Light Quiet Colorful Swan Pond and Unicorn Head Memories

The mirror shows us back to ourselves but changed. Memory mirrors what happened and what we needed to have happened. The swan becomes more elegant than it was. The unicorn head appears in the reflection though it wasn't there.

The swan carries grace it doesn't earn — it just is. The unicorn carries longing for what never existed. Both live in the same pond.

Space holds us. Time moves through us. Quiet colorful is the psyche's preferred state — not too much, not too little. The adjectives pile up because one word isn't enough.

What do we owe the reflection. The swan did not consent to be our symbol. The first time anyone felt anything visually was also the first taking — the eye as thief. We saw and called it ours.

Light enters the eye and becomes signal. Quiet is felt in the stilled breath. Colorful lands in the chest as expansion — more room suddenly. The swan's neck is a curve the body wants to follow.

The first visual feeling imprinted something the mind still chases. We've been trying to get back to that pond ever since. To see beauty and know it won't stay.
