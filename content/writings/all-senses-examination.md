We all exist on significant land. wide open. flat and mountainous. to human build up. structured infrastructure.

The way some politicians perceive is not a good sensing care for the soil underneath. for the soil under our feet.

Intuitive visions at best are infinite. each culture caravans and diverse caravans through history. there have been a wide span of differences of impacts to natural environments.

We are now experiencing so many more extreme fatal weather behaviors.

We will not be a downer. and go further. but just want to state that these are new realities.

. . .

Lassitude caused by virtual social media sites versus joy creating human energy.

Take a break from your phone and computer and go to a physical real place. then dig there. then examine over land. archaeological findings from under the sacred grounds.

When we think about it more often. grounds everywhere are sacred. and if not. should be. and cared for. for future generations. all of our collective future new born Earthlings.

. . .

. . .

No condition is permanent is something our people say.

Scouring against hortensis long bent legs and scarred bare feet. she never worshipped.

Your feet were calloused to a hardness that was close to leather.

She could walk across any surface.

You must know who you are always.
