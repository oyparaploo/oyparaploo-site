Are you having a midlife crisis at soon to be 60 years old. I am way past that. No response. Oh okay.

It is now my time. It is now my time to shine. until death and leaving this planet Earth life existence. And or other outer ring space.

Chop shop chopping block. Incredible worldly hero worry free. Worry doll wigs. Where can I buy one or more than one.

Who are they. Presently at just the born in concept stage.
