Solar radiation snowballs. To see ice that was there and is now gone for good.

Squiggle squiggle I miss you. Shimmy squiggle. I miss you. I miss you.

Warming uncertainties. Normal ice shelf. a raft is on the horizon of the sea floor with projections of a human bird's eye observing a crowd. or better yet. enormous school of silver always on the move.

Art makers and producers have lots and lots of physical evidence. And the works.

Valued and in monetary value over a short length of time. fast. increasing frivolous and viable actual art works.

Something to do with ice melt and global warming insanity.
