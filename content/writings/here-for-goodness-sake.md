Save the actual voice for later.

What color are we really. Are we camel. are we mosaic. ca-m-o-u. numerous colors and other things.

There is a crack in everything. that is how the light gets in. Words by Leonard Cohen. Lighten up, man. Get a sense of humor.

. . .

I saw something hanging at a place in the outskirts of Baghdad. The picture has never left my mind completely. To this day.

The most explorative and interpretive living artist today exists in the United States. the Twin Cities. to be more specific. Inspired by a vision quest. By a deceased artist's empathy. Left with almost nothing except works of art and a lot of responsibilities coming in.

Ups and downs. Working extra hard.

I will be the next contemporary household name. I am inviting you to invest in me. before my artworks become much more expensive.

. . .

Pre-visualizations. child and adult immigrant.

What does it mean. historically. to be an American. Does it mean that we welcome with open arms. Do we welcome with military arms. Cold weapons.

I continue to refuse to take crap from the contemporary art doubters or dream squashes. and look where I am now.

. . .

Where are you.

Nowhere. And that is good. Nowhere but here. and that is good. but a little extra weary.
