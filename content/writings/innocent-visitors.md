We are just innocent visitors. this is our foundational posture. Not declared owners. not experts extracting. but a vessel passing through.

Selves arriving without claim. What is discovered is found. not made.

Question of Good Spirit. address to something beyond ourselves. That higher presence. Each new project begins in dialogue with what can't be named precisely.

The questions aren't new. They have been circled. held. approached from different angles across decades. Visitors return to similar territories.

Oh them. Oh boy. Oh girl. Oh my. Our accumulated stories are too many to hold. language breaking into small exclamations rather than summaries. not absolute mastery. but a full spectrum of Ohs.

Also. our oddly overwrought historical body. work rooted in time and place but emotionally charged. sometimes insanely absurd. sometimes dismissed as hysterical. used to silence. A wordplay holding unresolved contradiction.

Stories aren't invented from nothing. they're embedded in physical locations. materials. debris. Placemaking as method.

Representing a portion of a God given day. including this running nose. and room decorated with common things.

Innocent visitors surface what our places already hold.
