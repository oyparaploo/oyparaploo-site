This is someone's devotional symbol of faith with rusty screws and short bucket lists glued to the backside of a telephone pole. They still have telephone poles. I thought telephone wires are underground.

Hello this is. how are you doing. how are you. are you all right. how are you feeling.

Possibly nonsensical lurk and or loiter here writings. arguments raised regarding whether the threads of words are illogical. make little sense. are nothing but foolishness. And worst of all the label definitions impractical and useless.

Guess we will have to wait to see in order to know for sure.

This is someone's devotional symbol of faith or the rusty screws in a bucket list and glued to the backside of. hello this is. how are you doing. how are you. ailing. all right. well whatever. okay you are sick. I hope you get well.
