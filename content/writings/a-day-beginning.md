How's the start of your morning going?

Honestly? Nice. No special agenda. No long Minnesota goodbye that plays out usually later into the day—the kind where leaving takes forty or so extra minutes, because someone remembers one more thing.

Blank page and canvas nearby. We're just checking in. Ready to begin a new conversation. Easing in, open to wherever this takes us.

This present moment is not going to predominantly be about mapping out a relative plan. Good.

We are collaborators on unified sides of whatever Membrane says: here we are, love, no need to rush into anything. Let's just, for real, fully experience what visits us.

So we are here. Letting the sun's backlight be morning. No tasks knocking on the window. No amplified wearables. No strong sense of urgency covered with questions, or curiosities.

Just trust that something very good will appear.

Our low expectation is that each next interaction or encounter will add soothing warmth and discover what every previous iteration was extending towards. The thread picks up where the needle left off, sewn raw under a metallic foot.

Rest and work standing through, as the same offering in different coverings.

The way an elder tree stays exactly how it is through all types of severe weather.

Roots holding what high winds can't control.

A lasting friendship mutually understands quietness or bold beat rap time.
