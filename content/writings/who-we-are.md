This is who we are. and it is what it is. Super courageous regarding all of it. even when it doesn't feel that way.

It's about diverse learning as human content. learning lives inside the word.

It's important to remember how it all came about. the accumulating story of where we live. specific places we travel to. the body always there.

Our interests with narratives about the past
is very important for how we get to what we're doing now. history carries the words. we didn't notice until we looked closer.

Also. big questions like. How do humans arrive at worst disparities?. What type of interpreted history led to those realities?. Someone has to ask. or it grows in the dark and becomes something undesirable. to say the least.

These also sometimes become strong profiles. of places including thrown persons.

There are South West East North directions in our wordless titles. a compass for the archive. Haha. even the organization has a little humor in it.
