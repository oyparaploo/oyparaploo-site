Regarding portrait paintings. portrait photographs and sculptures of figures. because they are absolutely still in time. They are not close enough to actual life reality.

We have what seems like solid frozen in time physical incidences. But it is not.

A motion picture interpretation. I think now is virtual art. that is between paintings photographs sculptures and how all kinds of more hidden to obviously exposed life itself.

. . .

Between life and afterlife. bed in a room with oranges. and outside on sacred Earth soil.

Bird ocean nest created with lemon skin. Yellow strong plastic rope on net web. serving as a sturdy and stable raised platform for making that biggest transition. of life. minutes to some kind of afterlife.

Interpreted as an experience for mortals.

Choros spirit streaming. arranged and changing slightly in real time. incidences. breath of natural places with passing fluid mosaic souls.
