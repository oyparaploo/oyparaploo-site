Feeling bad is not a great place to raise children. Minnesota is a good state of mind to be a video journalist. Also a decent place to nurse a disease or other illness. Weather here agrees. Cold outside meets cold inside. and somehow that's a welcome soothing comfort.

We have witnessed tots going to both coasts
and then returning after only a year or so
to this central North region. The coasts spit them back like seeds. And seeds need healthier soil.

In the end. which is also the beginning. it's about precious connections. Nice lives inside all kindreds here. We didn't notice until we looked closer at the flesh.

Where we are from
and where all of our parochial and non-parochial souls
tightly knit together their neighborhood. can also be a parish without or with a building. depending on the village block. Weaving happens anyway. with or without a roof overhead.

Simultaneously raising and sharing the stories
that go with the experiences. as in lifting something toward healing light.

Journalist points the camera at the comeback
then realizes they are returns. Lens becoming fogged by breath
of innocent visitors who came back home. to surface what this great place already holds.
