molding how we do not delete parts of reality just because they are very slow.

we want to be that that is in between two targets. two bull's eyes. portrait or dance performance. portrait sculpture or other object.

compositing fragments. working with interpretations of coming and going memories. some thought or visual projection from the past. conveying personal past combined with present moment. and viable today issues and concerns as aesthetic physical actuales. customized to personalized self made. ourselves made.

very intricate and very large volume of stuff recorded. to show just how big a problem. accumulation of for example nonbiodegradable stuff.

not just talking about it but also showing what that stuff looks like. to help ourselves and the public. the public or audience of receivers. understand the state of things within a less usual and more unique realm of live experience
