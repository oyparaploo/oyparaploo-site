Here comes a one percent-er in a silk suit with entitlement pockets. The endless museum ceiling is a delusional dream. Nose up in the air no we mean big ultra realistic nose made of resin suspended above. Clip those goat nose hairs. And over there a fraternity house made of clear glass. Around the corner a napoleon-ite wearing a modern version of a tsar's dinner jacket. Living sculpture. Down the hall a mannequin art party installation in a red lit room with a grainy transgressive orange video of an echo chamber of 90s creature comforts. And high contrast photos of big box plastic projected on a cubby space wall with lots of white space. Mesmerizing not. Fleeting fancies yes. A troupe waltzes in spinning and holding up pickets with the words GENERAL PUBLIC on each sign. One of the dancers is wearing an oktoberfest-size crazed or euphoric head for short attention spans. Gaze and stare. Look pink haywire. If you are seeking messages of hope you are in the wrong place. This is shock and jolt. Bizarre prestige. Big primary color plexiglass drug addict portraits and disfigured street person still performances. Even though reflections of dysfunctional and passive observers is high peaking interest visual art. lovely winged angels are still a favorite for most. Turn a six foot dime to monster consuming media and complex cubic display of emergency ambulance blurs. Everything is groundless and desperate. And certainly not all of what the world is.

Perfectly still leaves. are centering.

Early morning frost on the fence is far from fatal orange and red night flashes. The captivating gaze of a traumatized and then vacant girl's face. partially cloaked in her wonderful culture. Shadows play overhead. The rose garden has been changing for a while now. As usual every year. earth tones are appearing where edges of the petals are curling.

Be with peace today.

Drink from the well and say a prayer for smiles. singing. dancing. and infused moments when quietness turns to tanks rolling or tremors shaking and crumbling firm ground. When half-sleep has been startlingly disrupted by an unimaginable and unspeakable horrific event.

Wait a minute. this is taking a turn.

Sunlight will eventually stream in to any dark space and offer hope. to move forward.

Great sounding words. Waves rolling. Whisper of wings. Transfixed. Infinity. Perfect union. Spiritual experiences. Human spirit. Sanctuary to the imagination. A different dimension. Primitive and unspoiled. Solitude and silence. Earth and cosmos. Magnification of emptiness. What. New meaning. Time written on surfaces. Perils and hardships. Respect for the environment. Inner strength. Storytelling.
