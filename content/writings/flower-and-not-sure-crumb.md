We love your color scheme so to speak. We like Georgia out in the desert around Taos New Mexico.

We too find a little flower and use that thought to make something that will be very big.

Mortal human bird. look what washed up on the desert shore. filled with human conceived and invented made stuff. And sometimes burning up.

Forgot to mention seemingly infinite Earth's fast melting ice shelves. causing sea levels to rise. oceans to air to ozone warming. causing more frequent terrible awful varieties of climate events or storms. extensive damage.

How did you go from we love your color scheme to Georgia O'Keeffe to global warming.

True. That is true. It is kind of. I am not sure.
