our vomit writings. sight smell stuff. before I cried. then I died. became fully alive again.

violence over there. we can make a body. immortal spirit smile. wonderfully tired and still sort of able to make animal anima and human multiple.

best wishes are all sensory all senses. ear nose mouth. your nose mouth and throat. touch touch to the fingers. anything and everything trying to salute the flag but having a very hard time. this is America. crazy stuff all the crazy stuff. putting up walls. gates.

we mortals are the foolish and obsessive train. over and over. energy spent.

. . .

when we cause a human to come out of their dance and skin. that is when you got it right. trying to get it right. that is what perfection is. trying to get right.

oui oui oui oui oui oui.

when artists. disaster. energy over and over. energy. busy busy busy bodies. trained. practice practice practice for your legacy and give your work more legs. lots of insect legs mortals.

we were the fools in the obsessive train. spent. woke up the next day bright and early. the sun up ready to go. lunch pail under the arm
