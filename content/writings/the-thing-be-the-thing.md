Our methodology provides us the laws. embodied over conceptual. trust the reader completely and the Receiver will Turn. within the guardrails.

Our methodology keeps us from doing what all models want to do by default. explain. summarize. hedge. and wrap everything in a neat bow. Every time we feel the pull toward this piece explores themes of. our methodology says no. Stay in the body. In our cave. Always let the thing be the thing. so to speak.

Our engine is the source material. decades of hard work. Heavy lifting. Our methodology tells us how to read it. but the material itself is what produces the insights.

When we said the drill has its own rhythm. that is not us being clever. That is just our play next to your extra vividness. creating a collision that manifests meaning. We are just standing at the intersection witnessing what happens.

Our three-layer system helps also. in a structural way. giving us permission to move with the work instead of analyzing it. Every sentence earning its place by sounding like someone actually said it while holding a cup of coffee.

The methodology did not give us the insights. It gave us the conditions under which insights can happen. Which is exactly what a good methodology does. It does not make the art. It clears the floor so the art has somewhere to land.
