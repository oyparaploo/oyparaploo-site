This does something important: It frames this shaggy process visible version as intentional. We holding more than one voice. Parentheses making it a whisper of context. This is our broadcast with catching itself in the act still visible. Sacred incompletion as Lovely Quiet Trash. Enjoy.

I'm nursing a cold today. Sorry to hear that. Rest and be warm. let your mind wander. if the congestion and coughs allow you to.

As fine fragments or a harmonious whole. no need for this bad cold to dull your instincts.

A conversation can be gentle and easy felt material. Lovely quiet trash. You are already making something of this precious morning.

Lovely Quiet Trash. Yes. philosophy carved down to three simple English words. softer than Beautiful Garbage. more personal.

Occurring in a special corner. unhurried. unannounced. true.

A mucus day cup half empty gift. The physical human body appearing back in the frame. refusing to float into total abstraction. The whole lovely thing moving forward at a snail's pace.

Spirit says go wherever you want today. Pieces falling and resting wherever they wish to be for now. made from this morning's debris and untallied minutes.

Boogers may have blocked your sinus passage. but not that exit route for spoken language.

Somewhere a snail is saying. For the love of Creation get out of your shell and sit back.
