It is just too painful to show red blood. So the white stains and marks represent red human and animal blood.

Not sure what it means. But I killed a pretty awake invention. Pretty woke invention. In our art studio garage.

And it is foolish most of the time. Most of the time I felt sorry for myself. was frustrated.

I could be that harmless moth that came to me. the controller operator of warm to cool artificial light.
