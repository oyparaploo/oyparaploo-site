we sometimes have a lot of fear. our nation has a lot of fear also. a lot of fears also today and in numerous cases rightly so. fear has rarely accomplished positive actions for any society.

when fear sets in. the willfully determined mentally prepared to shag it away. out of mind. away from your other subjects. away from a walk. away from all of your subject matter.

this song and dance. we will work our asses off right now. creating a very interesting situation. and life and things.

now that we do not have to as much. when we are elders then we can travel a lot more. then we can actually travel a lot more to other nations.

. . .

there is wisdom in everything. human minds. human made objects and human made objects. broken stuff. damaged things. if you are open enough to look for it.

all how it is. our dominantly physically solitary life is good. not perfect by any means but good. at the moment we work alone all day. in the diverse things we have created over many years. to what it is all about now moving forward.

we work all by ourselves. we work by ourselves. we work all by ourselves. amongst thousands of things.

and we are connected by. we are also with good feelings. with very nice feelings connected by our close community. community that does errands and is of service to others. and with our devices. and also with our tech devices and text communication. sitting standing and walking or advancing. being of value in different ways.

response to a ripped apart. a woman's combat boot. the combat boot of a woman ripped apart. laying there to be recorded on a stony landscape.

and we got it. it is a crazy or insane object. it is an aftermath reality and expression having to do with something that happened in a green zone where deadly violence occurs frequently
