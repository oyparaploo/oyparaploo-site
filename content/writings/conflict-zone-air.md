As an adult mortal human bird Earth laying. if I had to make a choice. to be down to earth and prejudice or not at all prejudice and up in the air. I would every time choose to be up in the air.

Earth and air types without anything else attached I believe are all good though. Nothing wrong with living fully in the atmospheres of the unknown.

With your own unconditional kindness towards all living beings and things. manifesting good energy is more important than many people sense or think on a continual basis.

Sending out wishes and prayers for better consistent good energy. especially the places on earth that are between where conflicts exist.
