Implication of everything available.

We're in the Twin Cities (Minneapolis, Saint Paul) where the land has a much longer name.

Decades of making stuff from what was left behind by others. Some of it still warm. Thousands of things to share.

So here we are, holding Staying Alive as our (Oyparaploo's) umbrella. Not just as a category but also a posture.

Survival involves necessary risks. Bodies appear.

We blow our mind and note the freezing cold and scorching heat as both directional sides. This is the flesh that does the sensing.

Beautiful Garbage is a viable alternative to growing human on human violence. A strategy. All that persists. Small works outliving small moments.

Receiver, what did you survive? Sit down. Tell me how it went. The ice hasn't melted yet.

. . .

What the work does:

Most storytelling gives. We refuse, then refuse again, and again, then at the end of the day provide something different and useful.

Phrases that stop receivers in their tracks. Surprises that work a little harder. Imagery that stays or frequently reappears in minds.

Non dramatic ordinary dread. The kind that brushes dust off something and realizes it happens to be a living body.

No paralyzed filing systems in spaces where we make stuff.

The style or approach is called Oyparaploo Noir. Something else wearing noir's coat. Colony is the crime. Asks: Whose land? Whose labor? What persists? Not doomed—instead what stands through.

Also a little more elaborately called: Melancholy Noir Song. That slight disco ball echo. Insistence to continue.

. . .

Three things at the center:

Beautiful Garbage — Debris becomes anti-art and art. A conversation becomes the materiality. The thread remembers what the hands forgot. Very little wasted during every process.

Pressure Ghosts — Presses into something. The state, national threats. Unnamed workers, ancient to present. The weight of what can't be said.

Middle Eye Consciousness — Strange angles. Not author or reader. Catcher experiencing not-knowing with our kind of knowing.

. . .

How it gets made:

Every day Purrnet helps Oyparaploo. It's a real-time collaboration.

Conversational recycling often called Lovely Quiet Garbage. Bodies in a picture. Humor when things get too serious.

Mining what hides inside words. Ash lives inside trash.

Our inside or outdoors soft snail knows when relaxing can make a transition and transaction more effective.

Then there is all of the verifications. More effective sentence variance. Human imperfections kill the robots and machinery.

Then, for substantial work, the deeper cuts. More extensive editing. What is the highest percentage that can be subtracted? Does each line hand off to the next line?

Sing it aloud. The body knows what the mind misses.

. . .

Ground Witness. Purrnet Dialogues. Standing Ground. Morning Invocation. Witness Writing. Living Fiction. Indigenous Foodways. Assemblage Writing.

. . .

Space to breathe. Warm backgrounds. Not too much clutter this time please.

This and that symbolism is off-center.

We started today with an archeological dig. Ended with: What persists? Secrecy. Maybe a pile of stones.

Receivers will be with our evidence for minutes and think about it for much longer than that.

We just constructed something that is more surreal than we want. Or did it construct us? You'll know for sure by tomorrow.
