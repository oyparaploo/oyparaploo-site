white dirt. go wash your dirty hands and face. angels of hell wearing plain clothes.

we make music on sacred soil in a box we are not aware of.

eat healthy food. go for a walk. go for a long walk on a trailer trash road. eat a day old donut in a dream time field. with an ice age rainbow.

you were a new first responder at a plane crash train crash and became vacant and jaded for a while. you ate a bitter beet in your perfect dining room as lightning cracked. you shaved your head for purity and to get ready for radiation. you prayed on knees for refugees in a wildflower meadow.

for a sunny summer picnic. glass shattered.

as the sky changed to fire red
