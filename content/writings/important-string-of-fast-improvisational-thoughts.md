A catalog of the mind at full speed. Everything it touched in the time it takes to forget where you put the keys.

Worship. The first word. Before anything else. The mind starts on its knees.

Swim and hoard. Two instructions that cancel each other out. You cannot swim while hoarding. You cannot hoard while swimming. Pick one. The mind picks both.

Humankind. One word that is two words pretending to be one. The human and the kind. Not always at the same time.

Choose honey. Over what. Over vinegar. Over bitterness. Over the other thing in the cabinet that looks like honey but is not. Choose honey.

Hot bathwater. The only place where the body and the mind agree to stop arguing.

Meditation. The practice of sitting still while everything inside you runs.

Midnight blue burka. A color and a garment and a time of day. A woman wrapped in the sky at the hour when the sky is darkest. The mind saw her and kept going but did not forget.

Optimism. Placed directly after the burka. Because the mind knows what it is doing even when it pretends it does not.

Lost my job but not my home. The American prayer. The subtraction that stops one line before the floor.

Big box sleepwalker. A person moving through a warehouse store with their eyes open and their mind closed. The fluorescent lights are the dream. The cart is the bed.

Brain works legs. Three words that describe walking and also describe everything the brain does. The brain has no hands. The brain works legs.

Strip mall dancers tonight. A performance in a parking lot shared by a nail salon and a tax preparer. The dancers do not care what is next door. The dancing is the point. Tonight is the only night that matters.

The value of manure today. What is waste worth. Today. Not yesterday. Today the price has changed. The value of manure is always changing because the value of what grows from it is always changing.

Prison pipeline. Two words that should not be a phrase and are a phrase and are an industry.

Financial ambitions. Placed directly after the prison pipeline. Because the mind knows what it is doing.

Sympathy for gray winter minds. The minds that go gray when the sky does. November through March in a northern city. The sympathy is not pity. The sympathy is recognition.

I am too young to die without shallow fame. The most honest sentence in the archive. Not deep fame. Shallow fame. The kind where someone recognizes you at the grocery store and cannot remember why. Even that would be enough.

Meth trailers. Two words that are an entire documentary. The trailer is a home. The meth makes it not a home. The trailer does not get to choose.

Bright fluorescent pink and yellow clearance sale. The colors that mean something is ending and also something is cheap. The loudest colors are always announcing a loss.

Obliterated comfort zone. Not exited. Not pushed past. Obliterated. The comfort zone is rubble. Good.

Crying over burnt toast. The toast is not why you are crying. The toast is just the thing that said now. The tears were already there. The toast gave them permission.

I heard something splash in the river. Something went in. We do not know what. The splash is the only evidence. The river is not talking.

It is easier to jog than walk fast. This is true and nobody talks about it. Walking fast is a negotiation between dignity and urgency. Jogging is a surrender to urgency that looks intentional.

We are witnessing a new dental veneer revolution. The teeth are getting whiter. The smiles are getting more expensive. The revolution will be televised and it will have perfect teeth.

Your arms were put there by the great unknown to hug the needy. The most serious sentence disguised as the most ridiculous sentence. The great unknown has opinions about your arms. The opinion is that they should be around someone who needs them.

Sunrise solutions for smog in China goes to the big screen. The last thought. The mind went from worship to China in under a minute. It started on its knees and ended at the movies. The smog is real. The sunrise is a solution. The big screen is where we go to watch solutions that have not happened yet.
