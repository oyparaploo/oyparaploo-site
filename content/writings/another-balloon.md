Miss Mr. Miss Mr. lonely butterfly alone come down. Miss Mr alone. royal butterfly. come down from up there.

Boys and girls. silvery boys and girls. invest in your own special coming around again and again.

Bowel movement grin. body fluids journey.

. . .

See again who we are with a wide range of. sorbet to deep bodied colors. and whole nakedness that goes with it.

Tender glossy young eyes. broken.

Elder smiles along with many folds for compositions of lines. a broken elder face. not broken typography of wrinkles. incredible real natural work of art itself.

Creases lines folds furrows in amazing complex composed arrangement. naturally flowing around features of the face. most people call them wrinkles.

. . .

Someday soon takes on a whole new meaning. including breaths. including breathing. bad breath and swallowing.

Our distinctive aesthetic look and whole nakedness that goes with the styles. the line art of wrinkles are portions of skin doing their thing.

Select the best parts and shed a few. still to moving. of your under being spirit. pieces of covering and loose thin layers of flesh. not the rest but this bit.

This poem that does not rhyme.
