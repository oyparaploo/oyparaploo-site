We do not want to enjoy someone else's success. We want our own success. We have been enjoying other people's success for decades and it tastes like someone else's sandwich. It is technically a sandwich. It has bread. It has contents. But it is not our sandwich.

We want our own great contributions for history and future generations. We want future generations to argue about what we meant. We want scholars in 2347 to write dissertations that get it completely wrong and other scholars to correct them and also get it wrong. We want to be misunderstood in at least nine languages.

We do not want to be distracted anymore by newspapers. magazines. television. and home movies of other people's vacations where they stand in front of something famous and point at it. We have seen enough pointing. We want to be the thing that gets pointed at.

We want to be immersed in our own thing. Our own active body. engaged mind. and non-thinking mind. The non-thinking mind is the one that does the actual work while the thinking mind takes credit and gives interviews.

We want to go to the most interesting places now. With our mind. with our hands. our contemplative process. and the public's experience interacting with our wonderful original results. We said wonderful. We said original. We are not taking either word back. We would also like to add extraordinary but we are exercising restraint which is itself extraordinary.

Our unveiled evidence after years of sacrifice. Years. Not months. Not a gap year where we found ourselves in Portugal. Years of actual sacrifice where the sacrifice did not look good in photographs and nobody posted it anywhere.

All you have to do is walk around it and look at it.

And respect it.

Appreciate the hundreds of aspects that came together to make it happen. The early mornings. The late nights. The medium afternoons where nothing worked and we sanded the same surface for two hours because sanding requires no decisions and we had used up all our decisions by lunch.

We want everyone to love us. not just our work.

We want the critics to weep. We want the collectors to reconsider their entire collection. We want the person who walks past the gallery to stop. back up. press their face against the glass. and forget what they were on their way to buy.

We want the wasp on the ladder to pause.

We want the finch to land on it.

We want Carlos the Havanese to look at it and moan in a way that suggests he finally understands.

We want the writer in the coffee shop who said originality is dead to see it and choke on his cold coffee. Not fatally. Just enough to reconsider.

We want the man steering the jeep with his legs to pull over.

We want the accordion bus to stop between stations.

Is this too much to ask.

Yes.

We are asking anyway.

Middle eye wants everyone to love your test results.
