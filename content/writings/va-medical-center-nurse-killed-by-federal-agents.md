Loved ones. lawmakers. and friends identified Alex Pretti as the man murdered by a federal immigration agent. Saturday morning. in Minneapolis. A nurse who worked with Alex Pretti in the medical-surgical unit of the Minneapolis VA Medical Center. described him as a kind and funny nurse. who would do anything for his patients. and help his co-workers in any way. D.H.S leaders are portraying him as a domestic terrorist. Putting a spin on. blatantly lying. A colleague said he was the complete opposite of that. Soft spoken. and beloved by all of his coworkers.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara confirmed that federal immigration agents fatally shot a man on Nicollet Avenue near W. 26th Street. marking the third time an agent shot a civilian in the city so far this month. O’Hara. who appeared at a late-morning news conference with Mayor Jacob Frey. said Alex Pretti was a 37-year-old white Minneapolis resident and U.S. citizen whose only known infractions were minor traffic tickets.

In reaction to a media question about the federal government’s assertion that the man had a gun. O’Hara said the man is a lawful gun owner and has a permit to carry a firearm. The shooting occurred on the street affectionately known as "Eat Street" A racially diverse home to several ethnic restaurants. Phone videos broadcasted and shared show several ICE agents tackling a man to the ground. one agent draws his gun. and then the sound of several gunshots is heard immediately after.

Most of Minnesota’s Democratic congressional delegation, including U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, and Representatives Betty McCollum and Kelly Morrison, joined Frey and O’Hara for a second news conference in Minneapolis late Saturday afternoon. They said Trump’s immigration enforcement efforts have amounted to a “siege,” and demanded that ICE end its operations in Minnesota.

With 3,000 agents. by far outnumbering the ten metropolitan police departments. this is completely out of whack. out of balance. Frey requested help from the Minnesota National Guard to augment the city’s 600-officer police force. which has prohibited officers from taking any time off for the indefinite future. The chaos is caused by ICE. Border Patrol. and Federal Administration.

Alex Pretti. a registered nurse. worked in the VA Intensive Care Unit. and was a positive. light-hearted guy. Thorough in his nursing practice. Dedicated. A co-worker said. We enjoyed working with him because he never had any gripes and never complained. He just knew that he had to get the job done. and he was attentive to his patients. A caring person. Someone that always had a smile on his face. He liked being involved. He had such a great attitude.

Drew Evans. superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. said his agency was turned away from the scene by U.S. Homeland Security Investigations. which is leading the shooting investigation instead of the FBI. The BCA then sought a warrant from a judge in order to gain access to the scene. which is an unusual step. The BCA investigates officer-involved use of force in Minnesota. Federal authorities also declined to cooperate with state authorities on the investigation into the murder of Renee Good.

About a hundred people gathered at the scene around 9:30 a.m. shouting at federal agents. banging drums. and chanting. They set up medic stations inside local grocery stores. Federal agents used chemical irritants. pepper spray. and flash bangs throughout the day. They shot him on the ground, and they were surprised by their own shooting and ran away, protester Josh said regarding the viral video of the shooting. Andrea saw medical personnel render aid to the victim. but couldn’t get close because federal officers started to block observers off with tear gas. It looked like he was dead, she told a reporter. I couldn’t believe it, Andrea said. We have whistles and voices. Are we really that scary?!

By 3 p.m. hundreds of protesters filled Nicollet Avenue between E. 26th Avenue and E. 27th Avenue to demand that federal agents leave the state. Mourners gathered where Alex Pretti was shot. crying and hugging one another. Protesters set up fire pits and tables with food and water. And chanted Alex Pretti. Alex Pretti. Alex Pretti. Alex Pretti for a good length of time. Not sure how long. Protester Kevin said that he wanted to speak out against the federal operation Minnesota. Anger. a lot of anger. Kevin said of how he’s feeling. I’m trying to hold back that anger and fuel it into something more productive. They’re acting like thugs with impunity. Enough is enough. Despite increasing violence from federal agents in Minnesota. it is important for people to continue protesting peacefully. We need to keep the pressure on in a peaceful way to show the true character of Minneapolis. They’re creating this emergency. pushing us. to have a reason to respond in a violent way. Another protester that we do not have the name of said. the amount of force used does not correspond to the threat posed by such a small number of people. The number of rounds that they were firing of every variety for no other reason than to punish. The masked federal agents were essentially marching down the street taunting and pushing innocent people

VA Medical Center Nurse Killed By Federal Agents

Several Minnesota elected officials are calling the shooting an execution by immigration enforcement. Representative Ilhan Omar said in a written statement. I am absolutely heartbroken. horrified. and appalled that federal agents murdered another member of our community. Trump has turned Minnesota into a war zone. Richard Carlbom said. The video is horrifyingly clear: federal agents executed a man in broad daylight. Untrained federal agents are unleashing militarized chaos on our streets. terrorizing our communities of color. and repeatedly using violent force. Jason Chavez. who represents the neighboring Ward 9 said. the man was an observer who was out in the community because he cares about Minneapolis and and what is happening to its immigrants right now. ICE is a brutal invading force that acts without accountability and respect for human beings that look different than themselves.

Minneapolis Council Member Aisha Chughtai, who represents the area, posted on X that she was at the scene Saturday morning. She said more than 100 ICE and Border Patrol agents were present, and that they deployed chemical irritants against people at the scene.

Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty released a statement saying her office is aware of the shooting and working with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) to “coordinate a state response.” The FBI has refused to allow local and state authorities access to their investigations into the Good and Sosa Celis shootings.

“The scene must be secured by local law enforcement for the collection and preservation of evidence,” Moriarty said in the statement. “We expect the federal government to allow the BCA to process the scene.”
