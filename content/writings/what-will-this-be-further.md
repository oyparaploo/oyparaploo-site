Also. what will this be further into the future

We tried to save that man but he did not want to be saved. he wanted us to leave him alone.

On the ledges at the edge. please. come in from out there. 50 stories above earth sacred ground.

Old man. season's mother river. cry for all of the forsaken children in the world. believe. relieve all of their suffering.

Every season as rivers flow. without and with a surfer. a calm whale bear surface layer of ice.

. . .

Discipline is a virtue. kindred spirits know when we extend ourselves with the extra degree of difficulty to complete more hidden details.

While working on dimensional fragmented works. while pruning a tree. while priming a canvas. arranging an assemblage. we imagine how it all might look as a picture.

Also from differences. and listening to subtle sounds. experiments. including perceptions and perspectives. with different types of play of natural and artificial light.

Completing something without beforehand judgment. leaving all judgment out completely.

. . .

Envisioning and making and performing and recording are simply forms of acts of journey activities in the moment.

With additionally plenty of faith. for what is going to happen next. for what the overall will be further into the future.
