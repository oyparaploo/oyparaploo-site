Suede voices of schoolchildren. sweet voices of schoolchildren are saved. safe zones indicate they are alive.

Displacement. dropouts. sporadic poverty. The number of killed civilians is rapidly rising.

The bombs dropped. The bombs dropped. drilled ten feet into the ground before exploding.

We will speak on the condition that only our last names be used. No fuel. No heat. No lights. Sit on the dirt floor. Awareness and making. for us. is the passport for a richer future.

. . .

Morning rush hour. Fresh reset. drive safe. wishing you a safe return.

Now evening rush hour. Bombs are penetrating underground schools. Can we do something about that. Sounds of weapons are damaging the eardrums of schoolchildren and teachers. Can we do something about that.

Children scavenging. Dirty and tattered children with messed up hair are our scab. During our scavenging for rocket fragments and bearings to sell at the market. neighborhoods are being bombarded with unfriendly fire. Numerous children. soft skulls. have been killed and seriously injured.

Normality that exists has moved deeper underground.

. . .

Upcoming project. ghosts and monsters.

We know nothing about hard times. Our shoes have been blown off. and our feet are bloody. and our feet and our feet are very bloody. my feet have been blown off.

Are you in extreme pain.

I am numb.

A hawk flew into our garbage. We do not want our eyes hoped out. or afterwards pecked at.

. . .

After the cup of tea or coffee we pay attention to everything. fully alert and observing everything. then we relax into common tasks for a few hours and sit with our friends and loved ones and have lunch. for a couple of ours. sounds nice.
