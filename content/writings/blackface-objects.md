Typical humans get famous for something and too easily lose sight of. forget what their original dream was. We guess it is a common human nature trait. Their good intended mission for this life.

We feel a truly purely unconditional sense of love and kindness for very black mortal humans and human birds. for that matter. We have those kind of good thoughts. For flesh and or skin surface hues going all the way. for Congo blackness for an example. to saw a ghost. to Swede and thin whites.

. . .

Although we would like to add that we do not like blackface objects. blackface figurines. salt and pepper figurines and flat imagery of all kinds. It symbolizes a very dark and concerning disturbing Caucasian white American part of history.

Real. scratch real scratch. potential ancestral realities. or truths that cannot be denied.
