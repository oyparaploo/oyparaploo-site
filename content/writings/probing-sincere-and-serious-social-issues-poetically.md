The probe goes in sideways. Poetically means not announcing the wound, just pressing near it.

Anti swimmingpool: refusing the clean blue rectangle, the chlorinated leisure of the comfortable. The body that won't be contained in the lane.

Blue-eyed angels painted by hands that never saw the desert where the story started. The saint's face borrowed from the patron's cousin. Someone else's face on someone else's god. Whose heaven.

Nationalism as captured emotion — the real love of home twisted into uniform. The goosebump at the anthem, the hand on the chest. Involuntary until it's required.

Militaristic power held by the super wealthy: the purchase of violence, the broadcast of permission. Radio and television as confession booths where the priest is also selling something.

The old megaphones losing volume, buying louder ones. Struggling is not the same as stopping. Empires struggle in the boardroom. Bodies struggle in the street.

Sincere and serious are not the same. Sincere feels. Serious thinks it should. The poetic approach lets the feeling in without the lecture.
