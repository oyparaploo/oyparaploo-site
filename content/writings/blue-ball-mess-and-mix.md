this is who we are. and we have no problem whatsoever with trends. no axe to grind about anything. no drama to put humans on their heels.

we are easy. we are easy content. sometimes important content. funny. more upside down for the sake of heart. for the sake of heart soul then head. in that order.

most prophets were a little too extremely serious to go with their wisdom. but nonetheless they were regarding fairness and justice timeless.

that moment of putting ink on paper. to share works is to healing in more unique or interesting ways than just straight logical collected so called factual information. our favorite past works are like prophets left with the right thing to do.

we have always had a sincere rich warm fondness for all. and we mean all kinds of African Americans living in the deep south of the United States of America. going all the way back to a self portrait realistic pencil drawing of ourselves as shoeshine beings. children of parents that our grandmothers framed. and then during mother earth years after hung on the wall. hung on those portraits hung on walls. over even toilet walls. at approximately shoulder height.

. . .

cowboys. cowboy caps. education. lame transparent spirits interpreted as new performance works in between night and day. dreams half awake one eye open. the only way it seems for us to stay alive.

get our points across. go viral. draw from the full moon. all on this blue green. all on this blue blue ball. all on this blue ball earthlings having to loosely do without literal judgment. preaching with urgency regarding sustainability for all inclusive humans
