We can't tell you how it all works.

. . .

No problem. Most storytelling gives. Oyparaploo doesn't. Not yet.

. . .

Waiting? Good. That's the first thing.

A phrase should stop us the way a stranger's laugh stops us in a grocery store, or on a train. Not because it's loud. Because it's real and we weren't expecting anyone to be that gleeful near canned over seriousness or vacancy.

Ordinary dread. Not the dramatic kind. The kind where we're brushing dust off something and we realize it's a living body and we keep brushing anyway because what else would we possibly do.

. . .

Here's what we CAN tell you:

Those who know will feel the weight. Those who don't will look it up. Either way—somewhere else now. That's the reveal doing its work. We didn't stay where we started.

Overheard conversation. Intimacy without confession. Like catching two people mid-sentence at the next table and never learning how it ended, but thinking about it on the way home.

No paralyzed filing systems.

. . .

Receivers will be with a work for minutes and think about it a lot longer than that.

We just did that thing to you. Or we didn't. You'll know by tomorrow.
