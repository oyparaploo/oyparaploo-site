We move into the popular Textile Building and occasionally see a human body pass in the hall. Frequent safety lock sounds. Most close their doors to others or the peddlers.

We paint dreamlike aboriginal imagery over the long wall of the office. Floating spirit figures weaving into abstract forms with intuitive lines and dab dots.

Urban sidewalks. Client faxes. Weeks with projects and without.

The owner of the TV commercial production business next door says he is coming close to asking the bum under the bridge to give him a few bucks. Then lets go an evil laugh. He spends six months of the year sailing his yacht to the Bahamas.

Chez Banana on the first floor. Urban Wildlife across the street.

The secretary. who enjoys plastic gadgets. keeps the production business afloat.
