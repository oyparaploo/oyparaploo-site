Condensation prose.

Teller: We went to speak to a therapist about our story and was directed to a host of feelings. after clearing unnecessary thinking. we joined a therapy group sitting on chairs arranged in a nice circle. facing a blank or uninhabited center. and each other. discussing aspects having to do with sleep. triggers. coping strategies. importance of self care. stuff like that.

Psychologist Group Leader: Does someone have something they would like to share.

Wend: After writing my first autobiography and having all of it picked apart by an extremely critical and cynical publisher. I feel much more apathetic regarding English writing.

Group Leader: You care so deeply that the only way to gleam again is to display no interest. show with your posture. facial expression. speaking style. no enthusiasm.

Teller: With this culturally diverse group there are still relaxed faces and fortunately not one forehead-to-chin-phony-head-front. on to the next subject.

Group Leader: Who in this room early in the morning dreams with eyes wide open staring at their bathroom mirror covered with humidity condensation. holding anger inside that varies.

Roberto: That has happened a few times.

Kant: What is the point of getting involved with anything that has to do with powers beyond anyone's control.

Marian: With greater willed optimism fate can have blends of lovely hues of mystery. magic. and miracles. every person's journey pathways also include at the other end of the life's spectrum faults. fractures. pride. power. and fear. that have to be lived out to fully understand it all.
