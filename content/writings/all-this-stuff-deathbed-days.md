God. God. God. to get out of this zone.

We keep tripping on red bricks and broken gray bricks. some hard workers. some keenly perceptive hard workers. too often give up on spirituality. leave their books behind entirely.

Bad things happen. and they start to doubt. and they start to doubt good higher spirits exist.

We will never give up on our faith.

. . .

We will do and record our thinking. streams of thinking. now. so that we do not have to do much of it when our brains are frail. when we are so old that our physical brains are frail.

This particular spirit. lucky. has a head like an exotic Husky colored dog. and feet like a fuzzy rabbit.

In a pictured vision. day old PS can smell like salty salty chicken noodle soup.

Gorgeous variations of subdued colors glisten under brighter sun. this brighter sun. we might not probably would not go quite that far with our description.

. . .

Sing the praises of pirates. sing the praises of angels.

Many people we know here today are hell bent to get rid of things. though we understand the importance of clearing stuff out. we associate the stuff in our storage spaces as universal healing codes. or as a type of universal healing codes or symbols. directly connected to recollections. memories.

We also see it all as positive clues to help us plan for expanding and relating future experiences. future works.

A particular object does not have to be a precious jewel dragonfly. a bronze decision to hold on to. until that time when we are resting in our deathbed.
