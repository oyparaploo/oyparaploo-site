Art is a conscious alternative to violence. *Staying Alive* is a series of writings that explore what it means to remain — to keep making work when the world offers every reason to stop.

Each entry in the series begins from the same premise: that the act of creation is itself a form of persistence. Not optimism, not resistance, but the simple refusal to go quiet.

The series draws on thirty years of creative practice, the Beautiful Garbage archive, and the ongoing conversation between Reach Chimes and Clod Hopper.
